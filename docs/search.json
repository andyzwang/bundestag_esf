With a budget of €142.7 billion for the period 2021-2027, the ESF+ will continue to provide an important contribution to the EU’s employment, social, education and skills policies, including structural reforms in these areas [European Commission].\nProject Description\nThe goal of this project is to collate individual ESF+ projects into German electoral districts, and to standardize formatting between the various data sources from the 12 federal states (Bundesländer).\nElectoral Districts\nSee geomatching.R for the process of creating a bridge between the German postal codes (Postleitzahlen, PLZ) and Bundestag electoral districts (Bundestagswahlkreise, or BWK). The 299 electoral districts correspond to ~8,200 PLZ, with approximately 100 PLZ being located in more than one electoral district.\nThis data does not exist publicly (see here) and was collated through dual-mapping publicly-available JSON mapping files.\nPLZ Data [Postleitzahlen Deutschland, Updated 15.07.2023, Open Database License]\nConstituency Data [The Federal Returning Officer, © Der Bundeswahlleiter, Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden 2020]\nNorth Rhine Westphalia\n\n\n\n",
